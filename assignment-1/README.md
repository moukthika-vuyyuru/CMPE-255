## Task 1: Data Science Using ChatGPT Code Interpreter

In this task, I used the ChatGPT code interpreter to perform data science on the [Netflix Userbase Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavsmayan/netflix-userbase-dataset) from Kaggle. The goal was to showcase various data science modules, including data understanding, data preprocessing, cleaning, regression modeling and evaluation.

### Dataset Information

- **Dataset:** [Netflix Userbase Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavsmayan/netflix-userbase-dataset)
- **Description:** This dataset contains information about Netflix users, including subscription Type, monthly revenue, join date, country, age, gender, device, plan duration.

## Task 2: Generating a Visual Studio Code Project with GPT-Engineer

In this task, I utilized GPT-Engineer to automatically generate a Visual Studio Code project for my favorite application, which is an Expense Tracker.

### Expense Tracker Application

- **Application:** Expense Tracker
- **Description:** The "Expense Tracker" project is a Python GUI application for managing personal expenses. It allows users to record, edit, and delete expenses, view spending summaries, generate charts, and import/export data from CSV files. This tool helps users track and analyze their spending habits efficiently.

### GPT-Engineer Project Generation

To showcase the power of combining the ChatGPT plugin and Visual Studio Code, I used GPT-Engineer to generate a fully functional Visual Studio Code project for the Expense Tracker application. The generated project includes code scaffolding, directory structure, and relevant files.

### Screencast

I have created a screencast demonstrating the process of using GPT-Engineer to generate the Visual Studio Code project for the Expense Tracker application. You can watch the screencast here: [Screencast](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dBJhnGH00UwtSoV_FRkBtY36MdLT8kkr)
