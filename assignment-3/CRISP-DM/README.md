### Project Overview

In this CRISP-DM project, our primary objective was to derive actionable insights from the `amazon.csv` dataset, a collection of product details and reviews from Amazon.

**Key Steps**:
- **Data Understanding**: The dataset contains essential features like product ratings, discounted prices, and discount percentages, among others. Initial observations highlighted the need for extensive data cleaning.
  
- **Data Exploration**: Various visual explorations, such as histograms and boxplots, were used. These visualizations helped in understanding the distributions of cleaned ratings, discounted prices, and discount percentages.
  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Extensive data cleaning was performed to ensure data quality. Techniques included extracting numerical values from string columns, addressing missing values, and transforming features for better analysis.
  
- **Modeling**: An automated machine learning approach was adopted using the H2O platform. The goal was to predict certain outcomes (based on the code, the exact target variable wasn't explicitly mentioned in the snippets provided).

**Challenges**:
- **Data Quality**: The raw dataset contained missing values, inconsistent formatting, and potential outliers. Addressing these was crucial for accurate analysis.
  
- **Scalability**: The dataset's size might pose computational challenges, especially during modeling using AutoML.
  
- **Model Interpretability**: Ensuring that models were not only accurate but also interpretable was essential.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Advanced Preprocessing**: Various techniques were employed to ensure data quality, including data transformations and handling of missing values.
  
- **Efficient Use of AutoML**: The H2O platform was leveraged to handle modeling complexities efficiently, allowing for a more in-depth exploration of potential models and their performance metrics.
