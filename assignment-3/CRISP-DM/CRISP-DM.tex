\section{Data Understanding}

The foundation of any analytical study lies in a deep comprehension of the data at hand. This dataset, meticulously curated from Amazon's platform, represents a holistic snapshot of the e-commerce ecosystem, encompassing over 1,400 unique product reviews. Each entry in this dataset serves as a testament to a customer's purchasing journey, resonating with their sentiments, expectations, and experiences.

At a granular level, the dataset is structured across 16 distinct features, each contributing to the narrative of the product and its market reception. Some of the most salient features include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Product Ratings:} Central to our study, the ratings provide a quantifiable measure of customer satisfaction. Spanning from 1 to 5, these ratings offer insights into product quality, functionality, and alignment with customer expectations.
    
    \item \textbf{Reviews:} Beyond the quantitative ratings, reviews serve as a textual window into customer sentiments. They capture nuanced feedback, encompassing praises, criticisms, and suggestions.
    
    \item \textbf{Prices and Discounts:} Economic factors invariably influence customer perceptions. The dataset captures the listed price of products and any prevailing discounts, allowing for an exploration of the interplay between pricing strategies and customer feedback.
    
    \item \textbf{Discounted Price:} Derived from the product's price and its discount, this feature offers insights into the final price borne by the customer, serving as a potential influencer of their feedback.
\end{itemize}

A preliminary visual exploration of the data revealed certain dominant trends. As evident in Figure 1, Amazon's product landscape seems to be characterized by a preponderance of high ratings, hinting at an overarching positive customer sentiment.

Further, the presence of features related to product pricing and discounts suggests potential avenues of exploration concerning the relationship between pricing strategies and customer feedback. The dataset, with its rich feature set and comprehensive entries, sets the stage for the ensuing phases of data preparation, modeling, and analysis.



\section{Data Preparation}

Data preparation is a pivotal aspect of any analytical project. This phase involves refining the raw dataset, ensuring its readiness for advanced statistical and machine learning techniques.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Numeric Extraction:} The initial dataset had certain columns where numeric data was embedded within textual information. Columns such as \texttt{rating}, \texttt{discounted\_price}, and \texttt{discount\_percentage} were processed to extract these essential numeric values, ensuring they are in a format suitable for modeling.
    
    \item \textbf{Handling Missing Data:} The presence of missing data points can lead to biased or incorrect analytical outcomes. To mitigate this, missing values were imputed using the median of their respective columns, preserving the dataset's overall distribution.\\
    \\

    \item \textbf{Feature Engineering:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{review\_length}: A significant aspect of reviews is their length. Intuitively, longer reviews might provide more detailed feedback, potentially containing both positive and negative sentiments. This feature quantified the number of words in each review.
        
        \item \texttt{exclamations\_count}: The presence of exclamation marks in reviews can be an indicator of strong emotions, whether positive (e.g., "Love this!") or negative (e.g., "Horrible product!"). This feature aimed to capture the frequency of such exclamatory sentiments in the reviews.
        
        \item \texttt{discounted\_price\_cleaned} and \texttt{discount\_percentage\_cleaned}: Discounts can play a significant role in customer satisfaction. A product bought at a hefty discount might be more favorably reviewed than one bought at full price. These features were derived to understand the potential impact of discounts on product ratings.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Outlier Detection and Treatment:} Extreme values, or outliers, can significantly influence analytical outcomes. Techniques like box plots were employed to identify such values in the dataset. Based on their potential impact, appropriate treatments, including truncation or transformations, were applied.
\end{itemize}

The emphasis on detailed data preparation ensured that the dataset was primed for the subsequent modeling and analysis phases, maximizing the potential insights gleaned from the data.


\section{Hypothesis and Modeling}

To unravel the intricate relationships between product attributes and their resulting ratings on Amazon, a comprehensive modeling approach was pursued. This phase was marked by a two-fold strategy: initially harnessing the power of H2O's AutoML to identify the best model automatically, and subsequently, leveraging the Random Forest algorithm to delve deeper into the dataset.

\subsection{H2O AutoML}

Leveraging the capabilities of H2O's AutoML platform, an automated modeling pipeline was set into motion. The platform was designed to assess a variety of machine learning models, rank them based on performance, and identify the most suitable model for the given dataset. In our study, the AutoML process flagged the Random Forest as the best-performing model.

The performance metrics of the best model from H2O AutoML were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.0773
    \item Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.2780
    \item Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.2019
    \item \( R^2 \) Score: 0.0537
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Random Forest \& Hyperparameter Tuning}

Building on the insights from AutoML, we zeroed in on the Random Forest algorithm. Recognized for its adeptness in handling complex datasets, Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees. It offers the advantage of capturing non-linear relationships and intricate interactions among variables.

Initially, a baseline Random Forest model was trained on the dataset. This was followed by hyperparameter tuning, a process where various configurations of the model's parameters were tested to find the optimal setup. Post-tuning, the Random Forest model demonstrated enhanced performance.

The performance metrics post hyperparameter tuning were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.200
    \item Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.0766
    \item \( R^2 \) Score: 0.0614
\end{itemize}
